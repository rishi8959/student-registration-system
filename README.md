ðŸ“„ Student Registration System â€“ Project Description (HTML, CSS, JS)

The Student Registration System is a responsive web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register, view, edit, and delete student information through a clean and intuitive interface.

The system begins with an HTML structure (index.html) that defines the layout of the web page. The HTML file contains a header, a registration form, and a table to display registered students. The form includes input fields for essential details: Student Name, Student ID, Email, and Contact Number. Semantic HTML tags and proper form controls ensure accessibility and clarity.

To enhance the visual presentation and user experience, CSS (style.css) is used extensively. The styling includes a modern design with a clean layout, consistent color scheme, and responsive behavior across devices. Media queries are implemented to make the interface adaptable for mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. The form and table are styled with shadows, padding, and spacing to improve readability and aesthetics.

The core functionality is powered by JavaScript (script.js). JavaScript handles form submissions, dynamically adds student records to the display table, and manages the edit and delete operations. When a user submits the form, JavaScript validates the input fields, creates a new table row with the provided details, and appends it to the table. The edit button allows the user to populate the form with existing data for updates, while the delete button removes a student record from the list instantly.

The project is designed to be simple yet functional, with no dependencies or frameworks, ensuring it runs in any modern web browser without installation. It follows best practices in front-end development with clear file separation, comments for code readability, and a modular structure.

Overall, this Student Registration System is a beginner-friendly, functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application suitable for learning front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
